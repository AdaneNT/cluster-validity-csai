# CSAIEvaluator: Cluster Structure Alignment Index

📊 **CSAIEvaluator** is a Python package for evaluating the stability of clustering algorithms using cross-validation and distribution alignment. It is especially useful in text and high-dimensional embeddings, using UMAP projections to compare cluster distributions across data splits.

## 🚀 Features

- 📉 Uses UMAP for embedding visualization and dimensionality reduction  
- 🔁 Supports multiple clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, Agglomerative)  
- 📊 Compares cluster distribution consistency between train/test splits  
- 📦 Easy integration with scikit-learn and SentenceTransformers  
- 🧪 Designed for unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering analysis
